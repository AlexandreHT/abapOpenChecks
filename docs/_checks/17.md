title: Definitions in top of routine
cNumber: CHECK_17
rfc: true
---

Check that DATA and other definitions are in top of routine(FORM/METHOD). Traditionally variables are declared at top of modularization block.

Example:
```abap
FORM foo.
  gv_moo = 2.
  DATA: lv_bar TYPE i.
  ....
ENDFORM.
```
should be changed to

```abap
FORM foo.
  DATA: lv_bar TYPE i.
  gv_moo = 2.
  ....
ENDFORM.
```

Note: this check allows for customizing the order of TYPE, DEFINE, CONSTANT, STATIC and FIELD-SYMBOL declarations
